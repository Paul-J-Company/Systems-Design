### AI and Platform Engineering
AI, especially LLMs, are designed to take in an enormous amount<br>
of data and "learn" from it to achieve better than human results.<br>
LLMs like ChatGPT4, Llama2, PaLM2, DALL-E3, Dolly2, and Diffusion Models<br>
can outperform humans in tasks like Object Recognition, Analyzing X-Rays,<br>
writing boilerplate code, and other "creative" tasks like Drawing Images.<br>
LLMs learn to focus on the data that matters and filters out the noise.<br>
LLMs can turn massive amounts of unstructured information into structured data that people can act on.<br>
LLMs can be trained to automatically create tickets in your ticketing system<br>
and initiate the next actions in a workflow spurred by an incident or other IT event.<br>
Reinforcement Learning AI can outperform humans in any game<br>
such as Go, Chess, and any Computer Games like Atari Breakout, and Doda2.<br>
The potential of AI is enormous and I believe it will be used in every aspect of every industry.<br>
Platform Engineering is a perfect match for current AI technologies because AI excels<br>
in learning from large amounts of data and Platforms generate large amounts of data.<br>

### HOWTO: Use AI to Improve the Speed, Accuracy and Clarity of your Platform
1) Use LLMs to Write Boilerplate Code:<br>
   This accelerates the code writing experience.<br>
   Use AI Coding Assistants to write code in Bash, Python, Go, Rust, YAML, JSON<br>
3) Use LLMs to Learn from Telemetry Data:<br>
   Log data, Monitoring data, Analytics data, Trace data, Network Topology data<br>
   This helps predict future possible outages, find errors, and accelerates incidence response and root cause analysis.<br>
4) Use LLMs to Learn from Business Data:<br>
   This helps minimize CapEx and Opex.<br>
5) Use LLMs to Learn from Customer Data:<br>
   This helps your customers become more product and leads to a higher level of customer satisfaction.<br>
   
### My Personal AI Platform Engineering Objectives
1) Learn how to build, train and finetune LLMs on Platform Engineering data<br>
   to assisit and hopefully outperform humans in tasks such<br>
   as incidence response, root cause analysis, and Market predictions.<br>
   I'm using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)/[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [LangChainHub](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-prompt-hub/), the [LangChainBlog](https://blog.langchain.dev/), and [Chat-Your-Data](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-your-data) to develop my LLMs.<br>
   I'm using [Deepmind's PromptBreeder](https://the-decoder.com/deepminds-promptbreeder-automates-prompt-engineering/) generate prompts.<br>
2) Continue learning AI Coding Assistants to write code in Bash, Python, Go, Rust, YAML, JSON<br>
   Here's a short list of AI Coding Assistants I'm currently using everyday<br>
   to generate boilerplate code, which I review, correct and test; and also<br>
   to generate Documentation, Code Comments, Github pull requests, Static analysis, generate SQL<br>
   Github CopilotX, Codex, CodeWhisperer, Code Interpreter, Google Vertex AI Codey, Alphacode, BLOOM,<br>
   Tabnine, StarCoder, Polycoder, CodeQL, InfraCopilot, Cody, WhatTheDiff, Stenography, Mintlify, Kats,<br>
   Grit, Adrenaline, text2sql, askcodi, mutable.ai, Codeium, Readable, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, kiteco-public<br>
3) Continue learning AI in general and all of it's applications!<br>
   **I consider AI so important, that the rest of my life will probably be dedicated to studying this subject!**<br>
