This Git Repository is dedicated to the topic of Systems Design
and the roles and functions<br> 
that a Systems Designer, Platform Engineer, SRE, and/or DevOps Engineer entail.

These are introductory notes about the subject and is meant to
get someone not familiar<br> 
with System Design "up to speed" on the latest terminology, techologies and techiques.

It also serves the purpose as my System Design site for my home lab.<br>
So the examples you see, like:<br>
[HOWTO: Describe an OnPrem Installation]()<br>
[HOWTO: Evaluate a Kuberenetes Installation]()<br>
are things I've done on my home lab.

Start by reading the [System Design](https://github.com/Paul-J-Company/Systems-Design/blob/main/Systems-Design.md) document.<br>
Followed by the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/Paul-J-Company/Systems-Design/blob/main/Kubernetes.md) document.
