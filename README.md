# Systems Design

## System Properties:
### You want your System to be:

+ Secure: authentication, authorization, accounting (aaa); Zero-Trust
+ Reliable: slow to fail
+ Robust:  quick to recover from failure.
+ Highly Available: 99.999% uptime
+ High Performance: maximize speed/latency
+ Scalable: maximize capacity/bandwidth (take advantage of Economy of Scale)
+ Maintainable: maximize "frictionless automation"
+ Cost Effective:  minimize Capex & Opex

Every business has business goals.

These ***System Properties*** align with the high level business goal of ***"satisfy your customers"***.

### Your System is a Stack comprised of Layers:

* Storage/Data Layer:
* Network Layer:
* Compute Layer:
* Personnel Layer: all the departments and teams that are your business.

In order to achieve the above ***System Properties*** you have to apply the ***"best people"***, applying the ***"best practices"***, using the ***"best technologies"*** for each property, and at each layer of your stack (I call this ***"Full Stack"*** implementation).

This is a daunting task because there are so many choices available and so many different ways your system will behave depending on the choices you make for each property at each layer.

The permutations of choices and behavior quickly explode combinatorally.

This is just one of the causes that makes any System ***"complex"***; and why it requires a qualified ***System Designer*** to achieve these ***System Properties***.
Other causes of complexity include: non-linear dynamics, chaotic behavior, randomness (difficult to predict), etc. which are symptoms of the combinatorial explosion I already mentioned.

### So where do you begin?

It always starts with understanding your workload.

You can't make the ***"best choices"*** without understanding your workload intimately and ***testing*** it thoroughly.

Starting from a blank slate is different than inheriting an existing system infrastructure.

### Here are some System Design questions to get you started:

### System Design Questions:
+ Definitions:
  - Infrastructure: The physical resources that support your environment, includes: Data Centers, Platforms, Systems, Workloads, People.
  - Data Center: A Physical Building located around the world that houses your Platforms, Systems, Workloads.
  - Platform: The logical term that supports your environment: OnPrem, Cloud, MultiCloud or Hybrid?
  - System: the collection of components (hardware,software,people) that interact together to implement your Platform.
  - Workload: the main application your customers interact with (aka., your "Product and/or Service").
  - People: all your employess across all of your departments: Platform Engineers/SREs/DevOps/DevSecOps/Programmers; Sales, Marketing
+ How do you make decisions regarding all of the questions below?
  - Who are your Architects/Designers?
  - Where are their High-Level Architecture/Design Diagrams?
  - How do they strike the ***right balance*** between all the ***trade-offs*** during the design process?
  - How do they define clear objectives?
  - How do they measure success?
  - How do they choose the best Platform Design, Tools and Practices for your Workload?
  - How do they choose the best UX/UI/Frontend Design, Tools and Practices for your Workload?

+ How do your Architects/Designers/Programmers/Teams/Departments communicate and how often?
  - In person Meetings, Email, Mailing Lists, Chat, Slack, Mastadon, IRC; Video: Office365, MSTeams, Zoom, WebEx, GoToMeeting?
  - Every week, Daily (15 min scrum), every month, never?
+ What Environment/Platform does your workload run?
  - OnPrem, Cloud, MultiCloud or Hybrid?
  - Bare Metal, VMs, Containers, Mixture of All of them?

  - Open Source Software/Enterprise Software?
  - Monolithic, Microservices, Serverless?
  - Request-Response (Synchronous)/Event-driven (Asynchronous)?
  - Multitenant/Single Tenant?
